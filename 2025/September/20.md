What I Learned Today

HTTP is the basic way browsers and servers talk on the web. When you type a website address, your browser sends a GET request asking the server for the page or file.

A GET request just asks for dataâ€”it doesnâ€™t change anything on the server. For example, it looks like this:

GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

The server replies with the page, like:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

When you type a URL:

The browser finds the serverâ€™s IP address (using DNS).

Sends a GET request to that server.

Gets the HTML page back.

Loads the page and asks for other files like CSS and images.

Example: Visiting fullstackopen.com works this wayâ€”your browser asks for the page and then all related files.

Key point: HTTP GET is how browsers get information from servers. This is the foundation of how web pages load.
