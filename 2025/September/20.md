🔖 Topic: HTTP GET

## What I Learned Today

HTTP GET is a way your browser asks a web server to send information, like a webpage or image.

When you type a website address or click a link, your browser sends a GET request to the server.

The server responds by sending back the data you asked for.

This is how webpages load and show up on your screen.

Think of it like asking a friend, “Can you give me that book?” — the friend (server) then hands it to you (browser).

Key point: GET requests retrieve data without changing anything on the server.
