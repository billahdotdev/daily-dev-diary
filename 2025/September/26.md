## What I Learned Today


# Variables in JavaScript

JavaScript has different ways to define variables:

- const - Defines a constant, whose value cannot be reassigned.

        const x = 1;
        x = 4; // Error


- let - Defines a normal variable, whose value can be changed.

        let y = 5;
        y += 10;
        y = 'sometext';


- var - Older keyword for variable declaration, but it behaves differently in some cases and is generally discouraged in modern JavaScript. Use const and let instead.


- JavaScript is loosely typed, meaning a variable's data type can change during execution.





  # Arrays

Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic and can be modified even when declared with const (the reference itself is immutable, but the contents can change).

- push() adds elements:

        const arr = [1, -1, 3];
        arr.push(5); // [1, -1, 3, 5]


- map() transforms arrays:

        const arr = [1, 2, 3];
        const squared = arr.map(value => value * 2); // [2, 4, 6]


- Arrays can be transformed into something entirely different, such as converting numbers to HTML list items:

        const listItems = arr.map(value => `<li>${value}</li>`);


- concat() creates a new array instead of modifying the original:

        const arr2 = arr.concat(5); // [1, -1, 3, 5]

# Objects

JavaScript objects are key-value pairs, and properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation. Objects can contain various types of data (e.g., strings, numbers, arrays, and even other objects).

        const person = {
          name: 'Arto',
          age: 35,
          greet: function() {
            console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
          }
        };


- Dot notation for accessing properties:

        console.log(person.name); // 'Arto'


- Bracket notation for dynamic keys:

        const key = 'age';
        console.log(person[key]); // 35


- You can also modify objects dynamically:

        person.address = 'Helsinki';
        person['secret number'] = 12345;

# Functions

JavaScript allows for defining functions in several ways:

- Arrow functions (ES6) are concise and often used for manipulating arrays:

        const sum = (a, b) => a + b;


- Named functions using function keyword:

        function multiply(a, b) {
          return a * b;
        }


- Arrow functions are particularly useful with methods like map() in arrays:

        const arr = [1, 2, 3];
        const doubled = arr.map(x => x * 2); // [2, 4, 6]

- React Components and Passing Props

In React, you often pass data between components using props. For example, an array or object can be passed to a child component:

        const App = () => {
          const parts = [
            { name: 'Fundamentals of React', exercises: 10 },
            { name: 'Using props', exercises: 7 },
            { name: 'State of a component', exercises: 14 }
          ];
        
          return (
            <div>
              <Header course="Half Stack development" />
              <Content parts={parts} />
            </div>
          );
        };

# Object Methods and this

- Methods in Objects:

        const person = {
          name: 'John',
          greet: function() {
            console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
          }
        };
        person.greet(); // 'Hello, John'


Arrow functions and this:
Arrow functions do not bind their own this. In such cases, this might refer to the global object, causing potential issues.

- Classes (ES6)

JavaScript introduced class syntax in ES6 for object-oriented programming. This allows defining "class-like" structures with methods:

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
person1.greet(); // 'Hello, my name is Alice'


Although classes look similar to classes in languages like Java, they are built on JavaScript's prototypal inheritance system.
