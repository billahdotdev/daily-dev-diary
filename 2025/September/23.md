## What I Learned Today

What I Learned from Event Handlers and Callback Functions

Event Handlers:

Are functions that run in response to user interactions, like clicking a button.

In React, they are passed as props to elements using camelCase attributes (e.g., onClick, onChange).

They let you control what happens when a user interacts with your app.

Callback Functions:

Are functions passed from a parent component to a child component as props.

Allow child components to notify or send data back to the parent by “calling back” the function.

Help keep components reusable and maintain clear data flow (top-down data and bottom-up event communication).

Why they matter:

Event handlers handle user input and interaction in a dynamic, interactive UI.

Callbacks enable communication between components and make your app modular.

Together, they allow you to build interactive and responsive React applications.
