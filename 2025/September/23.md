## What I Learned Today

React applications can be built by combining multiple components, each responsible for a small part of the UI.

Breaking the UI into multiple components improves organization, reusability, and maintainability.

Components can be composed together by nesting them inside one another to build complex interfaces.

Passing props between components allows sharing data and customizing each componentâ€™s behavior.

Managing multiple components helps keep the codebase clean and scalable as the app grows.
