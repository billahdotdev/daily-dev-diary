## What I Learned Today

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML and is used in React to describe UI elements.

JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions inside curly braces {} to create dynamic content.

Under the hood, JSX is compiled into React.createElement calls, which build the React element tree.

JSX makes writing React components more intuitive and readable by combining markup and logic in the same place.
