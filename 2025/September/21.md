What I Learned Today

Traditional web apps work by the server creating the full web page every time you visit or interact.

When you click a link or submit a form, the browser sends a request to the server, which processes it, builds a new HTML page, and sends it back.

This means the whole page reloads on every interaction.

Example: Old-school websites where each action loads a new page.

Key point: Traditional web apps rely on server-side rendering and full page reloads for each user action.
