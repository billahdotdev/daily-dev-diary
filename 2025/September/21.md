## What I Learned Today

Modern web apps often run code directly in the browser using JavaScript. This lets the app respond immediately to user actions without needing to reload the whole page.

Instead of asking the server every time, some tasks happen right inside your browser, making the experience faster and smoother.

This is the start of building more interactive apps.

Key point: Running logic in the browser lets web apps be more dynamic and responsive.
