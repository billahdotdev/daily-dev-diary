## What I Learned Today

Traditional web apps work like this:

When you visit a site or click something, your browser asks the server for a new page.

The server does all the work: it processes data, creates the full HTML page, and sends it back.

The browser then reloads the entire page every time you interact.

So, every click or form submission means a full page refresh.

Example: Old websites where the whole page reloads after every action.

Key point: Traditional web apps rely on the server to build pages and reload the entire page on each user action.
