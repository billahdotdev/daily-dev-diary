ðŸ”– Topic(s): props: passing data to components

What I Learned Today

Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React.

They enable components to be dynamic and reusable by allowing customization through external data.

Props are passed as attributes when using a component and accessed inside the component as an object.

Using props helps maintain a clear and unidirectional data flow in React applications.
