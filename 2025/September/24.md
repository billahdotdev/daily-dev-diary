##What I Learned Today


What is the DOM?

The DOM is a programming interface for web documents.

It represents the page as a tree structure, where each node is an object representing part of the document (like elements, attributes, text).

How the DOM works:

The browser parses the HTML file and builds the DOM tree.

JavaScript can then interact with the DOM to read or modify the page content dynamically (e.g., changing text, styles, adding/removing elements).

Why the DOM is important:

It enables dynamic, interactive web pages by letting scripts manipulate the structure and content after the page loads.

Itâ€™s the foundation for client-side scripting and frameworks like React, which work by managing a virtual DOM to efficiently update the real DOM.

Interaction with the DOM:

Common methods include selecting elements (getElementById, querySelector), changing content (textContent, innerHTML), and listening to events (addEventListener).
